Description: A tool to crop PDF files
 This is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files. It is written
 in Python and relies on PyQT, python-poppler-qt5 and pypdf4 for its
 functionality.
 .
 A unique feature of krop is its ability to automatically split
 pages into subpages to fit the limited screen size of devices such as
 eReaders. This is particularly useful, if your eReader does not support
 convenient scrolling.
